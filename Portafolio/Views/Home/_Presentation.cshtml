        <p>
            Since 2022, I have served as a developer at Ochoa Technology within the Technology department. My primary responsibilities entail development for AquaNode, WaterWise, and validation testing. These projects require proficiency in technologies such as C#, ASP.NET, SQL, C++, Python, and Git. Additionally, I use ECAD software including Altium Designer, Eagle, and Fusion 360.
